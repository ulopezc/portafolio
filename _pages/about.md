My full name is Uriel Evaristo Lopez Cantu. I am of Mexican and Spanish nationality. I am a skilled team player with a strong background in IT environments. I am also able to work independently and am always eager to go beyond basic assignments to further develop my knowledge and prepare for the future. I am a quick learner with strong computer abilities, including proficiency in DevOps, MySQL, Tableau/PowerBI, C++, SAP and Swift.

I am interested in pursuing a master's degree in Data Analysis to further enhance my knowledge in computer science. In my free time, I enjoy hobbies such as fishing, reading and mountain climbing, which are prevalent and beautiful in my area.

This website is dedicated to documenting my achievements, projects, news, and interests for both my own reference and future collaborations.
