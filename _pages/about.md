My name is Uriel Evaristo Lopez Cantu, and I hold Mexican and Spanish nationalities. With a strong background in IT environments, I excel as a team player and am equally adept at working independently. I am always eager to go beyond basic assignments to expand my knowledge and prepare for future challenges. My technical proficiency includes Python, Tableau/PowerBI, Java, Data Analysis, HTML/CSS and Django.

I am passionate about advancing my expertise in computer science and am interested in pursuing a master's degree in Data Analysis. In my free time, I enjoy fishing, reading, playing videogames and hiking.

This website is a platform for documenting my achievements, projects, news, and interests. It serves as a personal reference and a medium for future collaborations.
