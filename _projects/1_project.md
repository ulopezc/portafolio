During my internship with CEMEX, my colleagues and I collaborated with our mentor to successfully complete a project. The project entailed extracting real-time information from the CEMEX Go Track app, and importing it into our Microsoft SQL server for analysis with the Power BI tool. We began by conducting a thorough analysis of the problem, and consulting with our mentor to understand CEMEX's operations and identify areas of value. Once we had established a dimensional model, identified key analysis questions and organized the data by setting primary keys, indicators and metrics, we moved on to implement the project. We organized the data in MySQL using queries, and created additional tables for future use.

 Upon completion of our project, we connected our SQL server to PowerBI, allowing us to create real-time visualizations of valuable information. The majority of our graphics highlighted areas where CEMEX could improve its operations.
