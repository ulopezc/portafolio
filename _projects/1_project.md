In an internship with CEMEX, my collegues and I worked with our mentor to get our project done. Our project consisted in getting in real time information from the Cemex go track app into our MySQL server to analyze it with the help of the Power BI tool. First we did our analysis on the problem and talked with our mentor on how CEMEX worked in order to achieve value. Once we had our dimensional mode, analysis questions to solve and organized data by setting our primary keys, indicators and metrics, we then moved on to start our project by organizing the data in MySQL with queries. We also created tables that we thought could be useful for our next step.

 At the end of our project, we connected our MySQL server to PowerBI and started to make graphics in real time with valuable information. Most of our graphs showed areas of opportunity for CEMEX to improve.
