During this project, my collegues and I made a MySQL server to gather the information that our college, Tecnologico de Monterrey, sended to us to analyze. First we analyzed the data by choosing who would be our primary keys and variables, then we organized the data by using queries in which we also created our tables in the system. Once we had all the information gathered and organized by type, we sent this information to our Tableu

    We spent most of our time on the analysis of the data and documentating. We started by stating:
    1- What is the problem?
    2- Metadata
    3- Analysis questions
    4- Indicators
    5- Dimensional Model

</div>
    
<div class="caption">
    Our Dimensional model
</div>
    
    After gathering all the information, we sent our tables to Tableu to analyze and we created several Dashboards with important data that the Museum would like to know in order to be more appealing to the public

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Tableu4.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Our Dashboard
</div>

We finished this proyect by doing five dashboards with valuable information in which some of our graphics showed Visitants by gender, Scholarity of the visitants, type of ticket, duration of the visits and many more
