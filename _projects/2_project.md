During this project, my colleagues and I created a MySQL server to collect and analyze data provided by Tecnologico de Monterrey. We began by carefully selecting primary keys and variables, and organizing the data by utilizing queries to create tables in the system. Once all of the information was gathered and sorted by type, we exported it to Tableau for further analysis.

    We spent most of our time on the analysis of the data and documentating. We started by stating:
    1- What is the problem?
    2- Metadata
    3- Analysis questions
    4- Indicators
    5- Dimensional Model

</div>
    
<div class="caption">
    Our Dimensional model
</div>
    
    After collecting all the necessary data, we exported our tables to Tableau for analysis and created several dashboards to display crucial information that the Museum management would find useful in order to improve their appeal to the public.

We successfully completed the project by creating five dashboards containing valuable insights, including visualizations of visitor demographics (such as gender and level of education), ticket type, visit duration, and more.
