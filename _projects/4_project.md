I embarked on this project with the intention of refreshing my Tableau skills and indulging in some creative exploration through the use of its visualizations.

This project focuses on analyzing and presenting insights on the Covid-19 vaccine distribution globally. To start, I created three key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the progress of the vaccine distribution: partially vaccinated individuals, fully vaccinated individuals, and the percentage of unvaccinated individuals.
Additionally, I created a bar graph that showcases, in descending order, the countries with the highest number of vaccinated individuals, both partially and fully. This provides a clear visual of the leading countries in terms of vaccine distribution.
Furthermore, I utilized a map to display the level of vaccine distribution across countries, with a darker shade indicating higher levels of full vaccination.
Lastly, I plotted a trend line graph of vaccinated individuals per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between vaccine distribution and economic prosperity."

This Dashboard represents the final outcome of the project, where you can manipulate and customize the view by selecting different continents and date ranges through the use of filters.

You can change with filters by continent, start date and end date and it will update accordingly.
